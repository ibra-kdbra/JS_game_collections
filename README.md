# JavaScript Games with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS

## Introduction

This project is all about creating games using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No libraries, no frameworks, just good old Vanilla JS.

## Why Vanilla JS?

Using Vanilla JS has several advantages:

1. **Understanding Fundamentals**: It helps you understand the core JavaScript language and browser APIs.
2. **Performance**: Without the overhead of libraries and frameworks, your games can run faster and more efficiently.
3. **Control**: You have complete control over every line of code in your game.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also need a modern web browser and a text editor.

## Game Development

Here are the steps to create a game:

1. **Design Your Game**: Think about what kind of game you want to create. Sketch out what it will look like and how it will work.
2. **Set Up Your HTML and CSS**: Create your game's "board" using HTML and CSS.
3. **Start Coding**: Start writing your JavaScript code. Make your game interactive.
4. **Test**: Play your game and fix any bugs.
5. **Iterate**: Keep improving your game based on feedback.

## Future Directions

As you get more comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you can start to explore more complex game development concepts.
