## Introduction

This project is all about creating games using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No libraries, no frameworks, just good old Vanilla JS. This approach provides a great way to learn the fundamentals of web development and the core JavaScript language.

## Why Vanilla JS?

Using Vanilla JS has several advantages:

1. **Understanding Fundamentals**: It helps you understand the core JavaScript language and browser APIs.
2. **Performance**: Without the overhead of libraries and frameworks, your games can run faster and more efficiently.
3. **Control**: You have complete control over every line of code in your game.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also need a modern web browser and a text editor.

## Game Development

Here are the steps to create a game:

1. **Design Your Game**: Think about what kind of game you want to create. Sketch out what it will look like and how it will work.
2. **Set Up Your HTML and CSS**: Create your game's "board" using HTML and CSS.
3. **Start Coding**: Start writing your JavaScript code. Make your game interactive.
4. **Test**: Play your game and fix any bugs.
5. **Iterate**: Keep improving your game based on feedback.

## Future Directions

As you get more comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you can start to explore more complex game development concepts. You might want to look into game physics, AI, or multiplayer functionality. The sky's the limit!
